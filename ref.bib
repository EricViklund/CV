	abstract={In this study we will show a new method of polishing for Nb3Sn cavities known as centrifugal barrel&#xD;polishing (CBP). Using this method, Nb3Sn coated samples are polished to a surface roughness&#xD;comparable to a traditional Nb cavity after electropolishing (EP). We also investigate different&#xD;methods of cleaning the Nb3Sn surface after CBP to remove residual abrasive particles. The polished&#xD;Nb3Sn surface is analyzed using confocal laser microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM)&#xD;is used to image the surface and measure the surface roughness after polishing. Transmission electron&#xD;microscopy (TEM) is also used for high resolution analysis of the surface after polishing. Finally,&#xD;we show that centrifugal barrel polishing can improve the performance of a Nb3Sn SRF cavity.}

  abstract     = {{To improve the superconducting performance of niobium SRF cavities, electropolishing (EP) with a sulfuric and hydroflouric acid mixture is used. The chemistry of this reaction is complex due to the interactions between diffusion mechanisms, surface oxide structure, and multiple chemical species. Past studies on the EP process have produced a certain set of optimum parameters that have been used successfully for a long time. However, two recent developments have called the efficacy of the existing EP process into question. Since the introduction of nitrogen doping the surface quality of some cavities has been very poor. Also, EP performed at colder than standard temperatures leads to an increase in the cavity performance. To understand these questions, we perform a multivariate study on the EP process using niobium test samples electropolished at different temperatures and potentials. We find that electropolishing at lower potentials leads to rough surface features such as pitting and grain etching. Some of the surface features show similarities to features seen in niobium cavities. The effect of electropolishing temperature is not clear based on the results of this study.}},
